## why

glicol can be very flexible and powerful for procedural game audio.

one feature is that it's very powerful for on web.

If you look at current solutions for audio, such as the one in this wonderful game:

https://dgriffin.itch.io/traverse

you will see that the audio has distortion sometimes.

glicol has a different solution rather than using cpal on web.

the easiest way is to use one line of cdn in your html.

see the examples/wasm/ folder for an example.

## usage

see the [examples](./examples/) folder

run with caution for unpleasant loud sounds!
